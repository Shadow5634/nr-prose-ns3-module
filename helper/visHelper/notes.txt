I] DOUBTS AND CONSIDERATIONS:

  - Check what and how to include necessary files

II] CODE DESIGN

  - All classes (no structs)
  - SetUp method with int return to highlight success/failure
    - Takes in the bare-bones parameters to function properly
    - 1 for success and -1 for failure
    - 0 if called SetUp again after a succesful setup
  - All other public methods only run if setup is successful and return status
    - 1 for success and -1 for failure
  - Classes link trace sources to sinks by themselves
    - By private method called LinkTraces
    - Trace sinks must be private as well
  - Trace Sinks return immediately on unsuccessful set-up
  - If possible attach trace sinks to only relevant sources - not all nodes/devices. Only for the ones provided
    - If possible, trace sinks should abort on invalid parameters (signal user that setup was incorrect)
    - If not possible, trace sinks will skip data and may choose to print message to std::cout
  - Standardize grah naming to use node ids and not layer 2 ids
  - End of .h file have a TODOs section for any leftover functionalities

III] COMPLETED FILES (only design and only have simple fixes left - mention
    functional changes in brackets) (have set Visible to false for individual
      files)

1) netsim-prose-relay-discovery-tracer-modelB
2) netsim-mcppt-basic-group-charter (only consideration regarding grouping by group id or assuming one call per group)
3) netsim-prose-direct-discovery-tracer-modelA
4) netsim-throughput-charting
5) netsim-prose-relay-selection-tracer
6) point-line-graph
7) step-graph
8) no-tracings

IV] MISC

- Look into automatic scaling for graphs (esp discovery messages) 
- The current method of the getting the layer 2 ids will have to be changed as
and when the lte and nr models are separated
